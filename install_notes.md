### Helpful Resources
- I mainly followed the simple example given here:
<https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/blob/master/programs/EditDemo.hs>
- I also refered to the main brick guide to add an editor: <https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/blob/master/docs/guide.rst>
- And the brick documentation is helpful: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick-2.1.1/docs/Brick-Widgets-Core.html>
